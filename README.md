# Quadratic Equation Solver Website

This project is a **Quadratic Equation Solver** made using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to input the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of a quadratic equation in the form:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

and get the **solutions** using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

## Features
- **Step-by-step solution**: The website shows how the quadratic formula is applied.  
- **Accurate results**: Computes both real and complex solutions depending on the discriminant.  
- **Interactive interface**: Users can enter values and immediately see the results.  
- **Clean and simple design**: Built without frameworks, only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Source code link**: A button on the website allows visitors to view the projectâ€™s source code on GitHub.
